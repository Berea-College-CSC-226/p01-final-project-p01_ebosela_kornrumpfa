## Instructions

Please replace each `**Replace This Text With Your Response**` with your answer.

___

## SECTION 1
#
1.a. First, discuss with your team and assign yourselves roles. Try to pick the role you’ve had the least experience in.

```
    |                 | Monday | Wednesday | Friday |
    |-----------------|--------|-----------|---------|
    | Driver          | ANT    | ARBY                | DAVID  |
    | Navigator       | DAVID  | ARBY//DAVID = *     | *      |
    | Quality Control | ARBY   | DAVID//ARBY = *     | *      |
```

## SECTION 2

2.a. Look at the three Python files in the repository. 
    Identify below all of the classes, and a brief description of
    what each one represents:

```
In the files: player.py, game.py, and NPC.py

    Classes:
       Player # Represents the character in game AND handles the movement of the player. 
       NPC # Represents the NPC in game AND handles the movement of the NPC.
       Game # Imports the classes from the other files. Game class for handling the game logic. 
            - What is the game logic?
```

2.b. Look more closely at the **t11_game.py** file. 
There are 8 lines; identify if they are 
    a) instance parameters, defined as: a type of input that allows for the creation of object instances? I.e. Instantiation. 
    b) method calls within the class, defined as:
    c) method calls to another class or library, defined as: 

(Some are more than one answer!)

```
    self.size = 800, 600                              # This creates the window and resolution. Is it [a,b,c]? | Instance paramter
    self.running = True                               # Is it [a,b,c]?
    pygame.init()                                     # Is it [a,b,c]?
    self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode(self.size)  # Is it [a,b,c]?
    self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()                  # Is it [a,b,c]?
    self.player = Player(self.size)                   # Is it [a,b,c]?
    self.good_npc = NPC(self.size)                    # Is it [a,b,c]?
    self.screen.fill('#9CBEBA')                       # Is it [a,b,c]?
```

2.c. Parse through the `run()` method of **t11_game.py**. In particular, note how the game handles 
    a) collisions between the player and NPC,
    b) moving the player and NPC around the screen, 
    c) redrawing the player and NPC after they move,
    d) how often the game updates the screen

In your own words, describe how the four items above are accomplished in the Game class:

```
    a) **Replace This Text With Your Response**
    b) **Replace This Text With Your Response**
    c) **Replace This Text With Your Response**
    d) **Replace This Text With Your Response**

## SECTION 3

3.a: Take a look at the **t11_player.py** file. What class does the `Player` class inherit functionality from? 
     How do you know?

```

```

3.b. Sprites need two attributes to function: A surface and a rectangle. The surface (implemented in a `Surface` 
     class inside **pygame**) represents the drawing that will be rendered to the screen. The rectangle 
     (implemented in the `Rect` class in **pygame**) represents the area where the surface will be drawn on the screen, 
     including its width, height, and position. Find the lines of code that implement these two ideas, 
     and explain what each line does. 

```

```

3.c. The `Player` class has only one method so far. Parse that code and docstring, and describe what it does:

```

```

3.d. Similarly, the `NPC` class in **t11_NPC.py** also inherits the `Sprite` class from **pygame**, 
     but it does a little more than our `Player` class. Compare the two classes, and identify/describe the differences:

```

```

3.e. Of particular interest is how we keep the `NPC` on the screen. Describe how we're using 
    the `self.rect` attribute in the `get_direction()` method to keep the `NPC` visible.

## SECTION 4

Using **t11_NPC.py** as a starting point, create a new class called `Good_NPC` (you can do this in the **t11_NPC.py** 
file, or create a new file; your choice). Have the new class inherit from the `NPC` class that I gave you, 
including calling the parent class's initializer. Convert **t11_game.py** so that it spawns Taco Cat as a `Good_NPC` 
instead of an NPC. Debug any errors you get; the program should work, at this point.

## SECTION 5

5.a. Inheritance allows us to produce special cases of a class, extending their functionality. Describe
    what challenges you faced while implementing the child classes that extended the `NPC` class. 
    How did you overcome them?
